% 
% form to use if you need the single drop letter followed by
% normal text (unknown if ever used by the IEEE):
% \IEEEPARstart{A}{}demo file is ....
% 
% Some journals put the first two words in caps:
% \IEEEPARstart{T}{his demo} file is ....
% 
% Here we have the typical use of a "T" for an initial drop letter
% and "HIS" in caps to complete the first word.
\IEEEPARstart{T}{his} demo file is intended to serve as a ``starter file''
for IEEE journal papers produced under \LaTeX\ using
IEEEtran.cls version 1.8b and later.
% You must have at least 2 lines in the paragraph with the drop letter
% (should never be an issue)

\section{Data}

This study investigates data warehouse models for housing stock price data and semi-structured alternative data. 
The stock price data was.
Twitter was chosen as the primary alternative data source because of ease-of-access the Twitter API and the large volume of available data.

\begin{table}
	\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.3}
	\caption{Data Features}
	\label{DataFeatures}
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{c|l}
		\hline
		Source       & Features\\
		\hline
		\hline
		Stock Daily  & Prices: High, Low, Open, Close\\
		\hline
		\multirow{8}{*}{Stock Intraday} &  Prices: High, Low, Open, Close \\
		&  High Bollinger bands\\
		&  Mid Bollinger bands\\

\end{table}

\subsection{Stock Data}

The stock price data was collected through an API provided by Alpha Vantage.
This API provided access intraday stock prices, intraday price features, and daily prices.
Intraday stock data contained 35 features sampled at 15 minute intervals. 
The intraday features were from the following categories Bollinger bands, stochastic oscillators, moving averages, and exponential moving averages.
Approximately 1 millions rows of data were collected, which occurred from Oct. XX, 2019 to Oct. XX, 2019.
During the collection process, the data were recorded in files organized by day and category.
At the end of the collection process, the files for each category were combined and pushed to the HDFS datalake.

\section{Data Warehouse Development}

This stock data is natively structured in a tabular form and naturally keyed by the combination of timestamp, stock symbol, and stock market.

Discuss normalizing the data - 3NF

\subsection{Optimized Schema}

Discuss the difference for optimization

Maybe a table comparing read times for the different options

\begin{itemize}
	\item S3
	\item HDFS
	\item HDFS mapreduce settings?
