1028827880061452289	@beindependentbb @VSLathiwala That is a reasonable assumption. It pays to hang on tight during parabolic advances, but to not get top heavy in entry prices.		beindependentbb		2018-08-13 02:17:35+00:00	247857712	PeterLBrandt

1028777674179670016	@sumitverma29 @VSLathiwala Parabolas on log charts rarely occur. BTC had a parabola in log scale, but AMZN, AAPL have not. Looking at Nifty in non-log scale completely acceptable		sumitverma29		2018-08-12 22:58:05+00:00	247857712	PeterLBrandt

1028378030865932288	@crypto_tyche Precise or not, one of the problems is that a trendline is about the weakest of all classical charting developments and the one most apt to falter or fail.
